After the opening of the Roshen fountain and the reconstruction of the embankment, this place has become almost the most favorite for every Vinnytsia resident. When the fountain is open, in the spring and summer season, the place is too crowded. But what could be better than watching the light and music show of the Roshen Fountain and then walking along the waterfront in the night city lights. It will be especially beautiful at dusk, when the lights of the night city are reflected in the water.</p>
